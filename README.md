## Production
CI/CD - [Jenkins](https://github.com/rdok/graphql-blog.api/blob/master/Jenkinsfile)

## Development
Copy .env.example to .env, and modify as per your needs.

The following script will run all the developer dependency commands. Creating web server, db server, and prisma server through docker containers.
When finished, you may interact with the web server for your dev needs, e.g. pressing `rs` will restart the nodemod server.

$ `./docker/up-dev.sh`

When you want to execute a command you may use the running container 
`graphql-blog-api_api_1`. E.g.: 
$ `docker exec -it graphql-blog-api_api_1 {npm run dev|prisma deploy|etc}`


#### Useful commands 
- $ `prisma login|token|deploy`
- $ `npm run get-schema`


## Infrastructure
Initially the infrastructure was setup on a custom Linux machine, with all dependency provided by docker services. However, because the prisma docker container is quite memory expensive even when idle, and with this project primary intent being hands on experience; both the prisma and the database docker services were moved to prisma cloud & heroku respectively.
As for the node web server, that still lives on premises, due to autogenerated SSL support from docker.

Reference to the initial setup; useful & good learning opportunity for future reference.
